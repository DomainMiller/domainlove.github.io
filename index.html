            <p>1. She is very mysterious, has a lot to say, but chooses to keep silent on the surface. ü§´</p>
            <p>2. Not an idealist, but a very practical and utilitarian person. Real life is a mess, so she loves to be sarcastic.</p>
            <p>3. Hates things that are useless to her, yes, that includes you who are reading this. üö´</p>
            <p>4. The above content is mostly wrong, but not entirely.</p>
            <p>5. Likes to look at adorable things, but just likes to look. üß∏</p>
            <p>6. A minimalist with a decluttering disorder, she threw everything away in the end, but hasn't thrown away her life yet... üòá</p>
            <p>7. She's easy to take care, just needs a lot of mental food, like lots of books and online courses. üìö</p>
            <p>8. She's not very happy every day. </p>
            <p>9. She thrives on brainy variety shows and books; these are her mental munchies. But beware, serving the wrong type of food can unleash her wrath‚Äîa perilous venture indeed! Proceed with caution. üö®</p>

            <p><strong>Autonomous Path Planning for Space Robots Based on Vision Measurement</strong></p>
            <p>The research background for this project is the placement and trajectory planning problem of a free-floating space robot, and a space robot system based on visual measurement has been designed. Initially, monocular vision is used to preliminarily measure the cooperative target, and the target's motion is estimated based on the measurement results. According to the predicted target motion velocity, velocity planning is carried out for both the end of the robot arm and the base. With the determined end-effector velocity, velocity-level inverse kinematics is employed to solve for the joint angular velocities, thus controlling joint movements. Finally, forward kinematics recalculates the position and orientation of the robot arm's end. Additionally, a system model was built in SIMULINK, incorporating a PID control module to adjust relevant parameters until the joint movements were smooth, and visualized the process of the space robot placing the target.</p>

            <h3>Latest: Lying on the Couch</h3>
            <p>My second book of Points of Views (POV), truly astonishing! The author uses the POV technique to create a wonderful suspense story and also provides a wealth of psychological knowledge. For instance, medications for treating depression such as Risperidone and Paxil are discussed. The writing is deeply pragmatic, featuring a sensitive and impressionable new therapist as the male protagonist, an ambitious and ruthless mentor, and a strong yet vulnerable female lead. The story begins with a veteran consultant embroiled in a sexual scandal with a patient. He argues that engaging genuinely with patients rather than maintaining a professional distance can be more beneficial. It seems his patient has indeed changed significantly, but there might be more to the story. Is this the truth, or just an excuse he concocted to seduce his patient?</p>

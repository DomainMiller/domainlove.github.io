                    <p>The research background for this project is the placement and trajectory planning problem of a free-floating space robot, and a space robot system based on visual measurement has been designed. Initially, monocular vision is used to preliminarily measure the cooperative target, and the target's motion is estimated based on the measurement results. According to the predicted target motion velocity, velocity planning is carried out for both the end of the robot arm and the base. With the determined end-effector velocity, velocity-level inverse kinematics is employed to solve for the joint angular velocities, thus controlling joint movements. Finally, forward kinematics recalculates the position and orientation of the robot arm's end. Additionally, a system model was built in SIMULINK, incorporating a PID control module to adjust relevant parameters until the joint movements were smooth, and visualized the process of the space robot placing the target.</p>

                        <li><strong>System Modeling:</strong> Established a three-degree-of-freedom space robot system using Lagrangian equations, multibody kinematics, and dynamics to accurately represent the robot‚Äôs behavior.</li>

                    <h3>Dynamic Topology and Fault-Tolerant Control in Heterogeneous Formations</h3>
                    <p>This project explores a comprehensive approach to controlling a formation of heterogeneous satellites under communication delays, dynamic topology changes, and various fault modes. By integrating advanced theoretical concepts into an existing simulation framework, the goal is to ensure stable and efficient cooperation among satellites despite differences in their dynamics, external disturbances, and actuator faults.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heterogeneous Dynamics:</strong> Each agent may have distinct system matrices, control inputs, and nonlinearities, allowing the method to handle structural and functional diversity within the formation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Topology Switching:</strong> Using a semi-Markov chain model, the network topology can switch among multiple predefined configurations, representing communication link changes or structural faults in real time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Fault Representation and Handling:</strong> The proposed scheme accommodates both multiplicative (efficiency decline) and additive (external disturbance) faults. A unified fault model enables comprehensive detection and rapid compensation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Game-Theoretic and Approximate Optimal Control:</strong> By framing faults as adversarial players in a differential game, and employing a generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model (GFHM) to approximate value functions, the method reduces complexity and computational overhead.  
                            This approach ensures that, under various fault scenarios, the satellites maintain stable tracking behavior, achieve convergence, and effectively adapt their control gains. The approximate value functions and adaptive weight updates confirm the robustness and improved performance over traditional, more conservative methods.</li>

                    <h3>Hybrid Control Modeling and Simulation for Heavy Truck Platooning</h3>
                    <p>This project focuses on the modeling and simulation of a heavy truck platoon formation scenario using hybrid systems theory. The approach captures both continuous dynamics (vehicle motion and spacing) and discrete events (formation changes), ensuring that multiple vehicles operating under uncertain conditions can merge into a single stable platoon.</p>
                    <p>By representing each vehicle as an agent with position and velocity states, the system integrates continuous evolution with sudden jumps triggered when certain conditions are met‚Äîsuch as two vehicles aligning their positions. To manage these transitions and maintain stability, logical variables are introduced to record platoon membership and prevent unnecessary repeated jumps once the formation is established. The result is a hybrid control framework that guarantees the eventual convergence of all vehicles to a common velocity and position set, forming a unified platoon in finite time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid System Framework:</strong> Unified continuous position updates with discrete jump events to model complex platoon dynamics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Logic Variables for Memory:</strong> Ensured that once vehicles merge, the system avoids infinite jump loops and stabilizes the platoon configuration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Robust Convergence Guarantees:</strong> Demonstrated finite-time convergence to a stable platoon, enabling reliable operation despite initial separation and varying conditions.</li>

                    <p>This project explores a multi-vehicle coordination control strategy under a Markovian switching sampling framework with intermittent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. By modeling the leader-follower platooning system in discrete time and incorporating time-varying sampling intervals, we leverage state feedback control gains to achieve consensus and maintain stable formation despite disturbances. The approach involves simulating three follower vehicles tracking a leader‚Äôs trajectory while adapting control inputs based on a Markov chain governing the sampling rates. Results demonstrate that, even under random DoS attacks and nonlinear perturbations (e.g., sinusoidal disturbances), the proposed strategy ensures robust and reliable convergence of follower vehicles to desired positions and velocities.</p>

That earlier project is available at <a href="https://domainmiller.itch.io/jumpy-bird" target="_blank">domainmiller.itch.io/jumpy-bird</a>.</p>
                    <p>TeaFusion, however, is the first game I independently designed from scratch. It took about two weeks to complete and was a truly hands-on journey‚Äîfrom initial concept and gameplay mechanics to programming, visual design, and testing.</p>

                            <p>My second book of Points of Views (POV), truly astonishing! The author uses the POV technique to create a wonderful suspense story and also provides a wealth of psychological knowledge. For instance, medications for treating depression such as Risperidone and Paxil are discussed. The writing is deeply pragmatic, featuring a sensitive and impressionable new therapist as the male protagonist, an ambitious and ruthless mentor, and a strong yet vulnerable female lead. The story begins with a veteran consultant embroiled in a sexual scandal with a patient. He argues that engaging genuinely with patients rather than maintaining a professional distance can be more beneficial. It seems his patient has indeed changed significantly, but there might be more to the story. Is this the truth, or just an excuse he concocted to seduce his patient?</p>

                            <p>This is the most impactful book I read during my university years. It begins with the Cognitive Revolution, arguing that what truly sets humans apart from animals is our unmatched ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers to achieve shared goals. The book then dives into a sweeping exploration of history, economics, politics, and philosophy‚Äîgreatly shaping my worldview and understanding of humanity.</p>
                            <p>One part that left a deep impression on me was the brutal truth behind how Western powers accumulated their initial wealth through colonization and exploitation. I remember feeling truly shocked when reading a particular passage: Harari describes colonizers landing like aliens from a spaceship, declaring, ‚ÄúWe come in peace‚Äù, only to begin killing and plundering moments later. It was darkly humorous and deeply ironic‚Äîlike a dystopian sci-fi film. The fact that entire indigenous populations were wiped out and their cultures erased left me with a heavy sigh and a profound sense of helplessness.</p>
                            <p>The book also offers many insightful explanations of economic and political concepts‚Äîfor example, the origins of banks and stocks, and how trust and shared myths power the modern financial system. In the final chapters, it explores the distinction between pleasure and happiness, arguing that while pleasure can be triggered easily (like through drugs), true happiness comes from a deeper sense of stability and meaning.</p>
